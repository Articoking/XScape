# XScape documentation

Welcome! Here you will find the full documentation for XScape, a Python library for recovering the seascape around a set of geographical points, based on [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray).

## Why XScape?

XScape can help you whenever you want to add environmental information to georeferenced events.
The information may come from satellites, numerical models, or any field represented on a latitude/longitude grid.

The library was originally developed as part of the [***PPR Oc√©an & Climat***](https://www.ocean-climat.fr/Le-PPR), a research project funded by the French government.
