# Installation

Until the package is officially published, the only way of installing XScape is by cloning the repository.
Once you have it on your own machine, go into the XScape directory and run  `poetry install`.
The whole process can be done in three commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Articoking/XScape.git
cd XScape
poetry install
```

If you want to **contribute to the library,** you will likely want to install the extra developer dependencies.
To do that, use the `--with dev` option when running the installation.

If instead you want to contribute to these documentation pages, use `--with docs`.
