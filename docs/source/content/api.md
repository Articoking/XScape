# API

Here you will find the complete documentation of XScape.

Keep in mind that it was generated automatically using the `autosummary` Sphinx extension, so some functions that are available directly from the `xscape` module appear as part of certain submodules.
In particular, the functions in the core module are accessible as `xscp.<func_name>` instead of as `xscp.core.<func_name>`.

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _autosummary
   :template: custom-module-template.rst
   :recursive:

   xscape
```
